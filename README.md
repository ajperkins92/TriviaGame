# Trivia Game
This is a Trivia Game built in Unit 5 of our program. This trivia game will feature the use of timer events within JavaScript.

* You'll create a trivia form with multiple choice or true/false options (your choice).

* The player will have a limited amount of time to finish the quiz. 

  * The game ends when the time runs out. The page will reveal the number of questions that players answer correctly and incorrectly.

* Don't let the player pick more than one answer per question.

* Don't forget to include a countdown timer.


*I was able to get about 85% of the way across the finish line on this one, but there are just a couple items that I was unable to figure out. I had a difficult time getting the user submissions of my multiple choice to map and subsequently impact the logic of the correct or incorrect variable. This means that the game is at this time not fully playable. Also, I was unable to get the timer end to trigger an event that would then display the number of correct or incorrect guesses. Everything else is there for this one though.
